            By using this movie booking application, users agree to provide
            accurate personal information during registration and maintain the
            confidentiality of their login credentials. The platform reserves
            the right to suspend or terminate accounts found engaging in misuse
            or fraudulent activity. Bookings made through the app are

            ensure they meet the age criteria for certain films, and entry may
            be denied by theater staff if valid age proof is not provided.
